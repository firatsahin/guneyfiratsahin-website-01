        "Hi, this is Firat. I’m an Istanbul, Turkey based Full Stack Software Developer / Engineer who has <u>5+ years of experience</u> and here is my story;",
        "I graduated from <u>Yıldız Technical University (Istanbul)</u> with a <u>Bachelor’s Degree on Computer Engineering</u> in 2011. I developed school and freelance projects during my university education period (which I have explained some on Projects section)."
      ],
      "center": [
        "In 2013, I went to <u>United States (Los Angeles)</u> with an internship program as a <u>Web Developer Intern</u> and worked for <u>1 year</u> over there. Although the company had offered me to stay at the end of that period, I preferred coming back to my home country for personal reasons. However, that didn’t end our relationship and I continued working as a <u>Remote Software Developer / Engineer</u> from Istanbul."
      ],
      "wkodeiam": [
        "I’m a pretty passionate engineer when it comes to developing <u>well-organized</u>, <u>smartly structured</u> & <u>valuable</u> features / products. I get enthusiastic when I’m discussing about the <u>architecture of the software</u> or <u>building the backbone of an application</u> which all the other functionalities will be based on.",
        "I’m more of a <u>project person</u> rather than 9-to-5 mentality. I <u>take ownership</u> of the product I’ve been working on and my point of view while development is “<u>adding value to the product</u>” rather than just “writing code”. So that being said, I’m a kind of developer that can be considered for <u>Team Lead</u>, <u>Project Lead</u> or <u>Principle Developer</u> kind of roles as well (now or future).",
        "Coding is one of the things that I don’t get bored of. I do <u>coding just for fun</u> in my free times. The idea of making the device do something for you or devices talk to each other gets me excited. I also <u>follow the software trends</u> and try my best to be up-to-date about the new approaches / tools (even though things change rapidly in IT sector).",
        "To wrap up, I’m a software developer/engineer who produces efficient, well-structured, clean, understandable, easy-to-maintain and well-commented code which solves some kind of real world problems. Besides coding, I prepare <u>good documentation</u> too if needed.",
        "Also, I am the kind of guy who is a <u>good researcher</u>, <u>self-learner</u> and does his job with a <u>minimum need of supervision</u>. Lastly, I’m also <u>familiar with remote meetings</u> (screen sharing, presenting/discussing things over it etc.) because of being a remote developer over the past years."
