        "Hi, this is Firat. I’m an Istanbul, Turkey based Full Stack Software Developer / Engineer who has <u>5+ years of experience</u> and here is my story;",
        "I graduated from <u>Yıldız Technical University (Istanbul)</u> with a <u>Bachelor’s Degree on Computer Engineering</u> in 2011. I developed school and freelance projects during my university education period (which I have explained some on Projects section)."
      ],
      "center": [
        "In 2013, I went to <u>United States (Los Angeles)</u> with an internship program as a <u>Web Developer Intern</u> and worked for <u>1 year</u> over there. Although the company had offered me to stay at the end of that period, I preferred coming back to my home country for personal reasons. However, that didn’t end our relationship and I continued working as a <u>Remote Software Developer / Engineer</u> from Istanbul."
      ],
      "wkodeiam": [
        "I’m a pretty passionate engineer when it comes to developing <u>well-organized</u>, <u>smartly structured</u> & <u>valuable</u> features / products. I get enthusiastic when I’m discussing about the <u>architecture of the software</u> or <u>building the backbone of an application</u> which all the other functionalities will be based on.",
        "I’m more of a <u>project person</u> rather than 9-to-5 mentality. I <u>take ownership</u> of the product I’ve been working on and my point of view while development is “<u>adding value to the product</u>” rather than just “writing code”. So that being said, I’m a kind of developer that can be considered for <u>Team Lead</u>, <u>Project Lead</u> or <u>Principle Developer</u> kind of roles as well (now or future).",
        "Coding is one of the things that I don’t get bored of. I do <u>coding just for fun</u> in my free times. The idea of making the device do something for you or devices talk to each other gets me excited. I also <u>follow the software trends</u> and try my best to be up-to-date about the new approaches / tools (even though things change rapidly in IT sector).",
        "To wrap up, I’m a software developer/engineer who produces efficient, well-structured, clean, understandable, easy-to-maintain and well-commented code which solves some kind of real world problems. Besides coding, I prepare <u>good documentation</u> too if needed.",
        "Also, I am the kind of guy who is a <u>good researcher</u>, <u>self-learner</u> and does his job with a <u>minimum need of supervision</u>. Lastly, I’m also <u>familiar with remote meetings</u> (screen sharing, presenting/discussing things over it etc.) because of being a remote developer over the past years."

          "- Shipping Integrations (UPS & Fedex): We have implemented UPS Integration to our solution which allows our customers use features such as getting estimated rates for a particular planned shipment, creating a shipment, tracking a shipment after creation, canceling it etc. just by using our solution and without any need of UPS website usage. I played an active role on that UPS Integration process from planning to implementation phase, I used UPS REST API with JSON type request to interact with UPS Services and stored necessary data to the related tables on our db.",
          "For another project (.NET project), I also implemented Fedex integration too which was pretty similar to UPS integration process.",
          "- Payment Gateway Integrations (Spreedly & Elavon-Converge): We have also integrated our ERP’s credit card payment option to a real payment process. I played an active role on Spreedly Payment Gateway Integration for Tokenize (Add New Card), Authorize, Capture, CancelAuth, Auth&Capture, Refund actions by using Spreedly’s RESTful API and our db as well. I also set up their iFrame solution to our front for transporting the card number from front to their service in most secure way.",
          "After Spreedly integration was done, we also applied Elavon’s Converge service integration too which was a similar process to Spreedly.",
          "- Other Solution Integrations: I have also contributed to some of our 2 different solution integration processes (by designing an integration API for other party to call and also adding other party’s integration API calls whenever they were needed in our solution)."

The common advantage of choosing our e-commerce solution over their independent web sites for our customers is; our e-commerce solution data made fully integrated with the ERP system. In other words, when they make a change on ERP (sales, invoice, inventory etc.), it directly takes effect on their e-commerce site. So they don’t need to update the same stuff twice.",

Or if they have their own design, we can apply the shop system on their own design too.",
          "For the system background, we used ASP.NET MVC5 project for the shop web site and ASP.NET Web API 2 as the data serving API for multiple instances of the shop site. That means multiple shop web site instances will be consuming one API to get their data. I implemented most of the parts of the App and also API’s authentication procedure which was kind of critical.",
